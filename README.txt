In order to run this program and play the game you must have pygame installed onto your system.

You will select a sudoku cell with your mouse. You can then mark a number in the cell with the number keys on your keyboard. To confirm your choice in number press enter. To delete a number, instead of confirming press backspace.

Sudoku puzzles are randomly generated from an API created by Dr. Yoonsik Cheon from the University of Texas at El Paso.
